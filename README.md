This library is being written as part of the Computer Graphics course at UNSW.

If you wish to clone it to work on assignments, ensure that you clone it into a **private** repository. GitHub offers free private repositories as part of it's student developer pack, available [here](https://education.github.com/pack).

As it is intended for educational purposes, this library is missing many desirable features and optimisations. It prioritises clarity and simplicity over all other considerations.
